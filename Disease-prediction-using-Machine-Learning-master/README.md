## Introduction

The Disease Prediction project utilizes **supervised learning techniques** to predict diseases based on symptoms provided by users. This project is designed to enhance the healthcare industry's accessibility and efficiency by offering an easy-to-use tool for early disease detection. The model can be trained using various datasets that contain labeled symptoms and disease outcomes.

By using machine learning, the system can analyze complex relationships between symptoms and diseases and predict possible medical conditions with high accuracy. This tool can be useful for doctors, researchers, and even individuals seeking preliminary medical advice based on their symptoms.

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Predict the potential disease based on the symptoms provided.
- Help improve the speed and accuracy of disease diagnosis.
- Facilitate the early detection of diseases, allowing for timely interventions.

### Scope
This project covers:
- Building and training a machine learning model using symptom data.
- Validating and testing the model on real-world data.
- Providing a user-friendly interface to input symptoms and receive predictions.

## Features

The **Disease Prediction** project includes the following key features:
- **Disease Prediction**: The primary feature of this project is to predict the disease based on the symptoms provided by the user.
- **High Accuracy**: The machine learning model is fine-tuned for maximum prediction accuracy by utilizing algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- **Scalable**: The system supports scalable training and testing datasets, allowing the model to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Model Evaluation**: The system includes built-in functionalities to evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **User Input for Predictions**: Users can provide their symptoms through a simple interface, and the model will provide the most likely disease diagnoses.
- **Visualizations**: The project includes data visualization tools to show model performance, dataset insights, and prediction results.
  
## Dataset

The project uses two primary CSV files to train and test the model:

1. **Training.csv**: This file contains the training data with symptoms and corresponding disease labels. The dataset is used to train the machine learning model.
   - Features include various symptoms, each represented as a column with binary values (1 for the presence of the symptom, 0 for its absence).
   - Labels indicate the corresponding disease for each row of symptoms.
   
2. **Testing.csv**: This file contains testing data that allows for the evaluation of the trained model's performance.
   - It follows the same structure as the training dataset but does not include disease labels, which the model predicts.
   
Both datasets are structured in a way that each row represents a unique patient with symptoms and their associated disease.
